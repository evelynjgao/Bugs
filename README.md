# Bugs-
An Object Oriented Program written in C++ providing a competition programming platform of a graphical ant simulation.

In the Bugs competition, you can enter between one and four ant programs into the competition and allow them to battle for dominance. For each competition trial, you must specify the names of the ant programs (e.g., sillyant.bug, gobruins.bug, USCAnt.bug, etc.) and a field data file (e.g., field.txt) that defines the layout of the virtual field that the ants will compete in during the simulation. Each contest entrant provides their own Bugs! program, like the one shown above. This .bug file is used to control each ant that is part of the entrant’s ant colony. You’re going to have to build an interpreter to interpret these Bugs! programs and use them to control the ants in the simulation (there’s more on what an interpreter is, later in the document).

The field data file specifies things like the initial locations of the anthills, pebbles, pools of water, grasshoppers, poison, food, etc.
